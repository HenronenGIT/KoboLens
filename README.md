## 🛠️ Technologies We Love

### Client Side
- **⚛️ React**: The library that makes building user interfaces a breeze. Perfect for creating fast and interactive single-page apps.
- **⚡ Vite**: Our secret weapon for a super-fast development experience. It bundles and serves our client-side code with style.
- **📝 TypeScript**: Because who doesn't love a little type safety? It makes our JavaScript more robust and easier to manage.

### Server Side
- **🌐 Express**: The minimalist framework that powers our server. It's flexible and packed with features for web and mobile apps.
- **📝 TypeScript**: Yep, we're using it here too! It keeps our server code clean and error-free.
- **📚 Better-SQLite3**: A speedy and simple library for all our database needs. It's like SQLite, but better!

### Monorepo Magic
- **🏎️ TurboRepo**: The high-performance build system that keeps our codebase running like a well-oiled machine.
- **🧶 Yarn Workspaces**: Managing multiple packages in one repo? No problem! Yarn makes it easy to share dependencies and scripts.
